add configurables (length at least) to obscufucateUserName()

server code should be runnable as non-root (except for showres?). needs install script work for this

make mock conf file

take out
  flagNodesWithSharedNetworking?
  meshLib
  calcLoadsOnNets

beer stuff from javascript

add in more comments from 0.90

make metrics slurped from ganglia more easily configurable and mappable to bobMon items

make all display modes be flexible, not just a selection of a few. need checkboxes etc.

add warning mode display or whole new front-end that displays ~pixels of various colours to highlight node problem

add iop support.

split mpi and other network (eg. lustre) traffic into separate fields

better mobile support - especially for sliders, but also reduced bandwdth xml and much less information displayed on client

'placeholder' in tooltip sometimes stays eg. if a job only ever uses 0 cpu

from the old FUTURE file:

- currently all compute nodes are assumed to have same number of cpus - allow this to vary (variable amounts of ram is already implemented)
- direct querying of the PBS server rather than via qstat, pbsnodes etc. - possibly via one of the pbsPython libraries - and the same for maui?
- client-side 'canvas' or svg pie charts instead of server-side png's - is svg really as ungainly to dynamically generate in a web page as it appears to be?!?
- further tidying of the code and taking out old cruft
- make network stats (eg. IB) and temperatures (eg. cpu/motherboard) more pluggable and configurable
- make the server side dump job stats into a database, not just write them to the log file
- query ganglia for the layout of nodes in racks instead of using the config file
- bobMon.js could be shortened, especially in the tooltop init/refresh duplications
- bobMon.js could be split into sensible sub-classes
